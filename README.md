Welcome to Moonlapse MUD: an open-source, multi-user dungeon designed to play directly in any terminal.

# How to play

Ensure Python 3.4 is installed on your machine and your terminal has a resolution at least 46x106 characters.

Simply download the latest client either using the download links above or by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
wget https://github.com/trithagoras/MoonlapseMUD/releases/download/v0.2/Client.zip
```

Unzip the archive either using a GUI archiving tool (typically integrated with your file manager) or by running:

```bash
unzip Client.zip
```

Now simply run the client package using python 3:

```
python3 moonlapse
```

or alternatively if your OS uses python3 by default:

```bash
python moonlapse
```
